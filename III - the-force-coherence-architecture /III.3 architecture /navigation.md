# Navigation

This file defines **navigation** as the operational mode
that replaces prediction under recursive complexity.

Navigation is not planning.  
Navigation is not optimization.  
Navigation is continuous coherence-preserving adjustment.

---
## Definition

Navigation is maintaining coherence while moving through environments characterized by:- endogenous novelty,- irreversible consequences,- compressed time horizons.

Under such conditions, prediction fails structurally.  
Navigation remains viable.

---
## I. Why Prediction Fails

Prediction assumes:- stable environments,- enumerable futures,- reversible consequences,- sufficient foresight.

Recursive systems violate all four.

As recursion increases:- futures proliferate faster than models,- actions reshape the environment,- validation lags consequence,- forecasts become obsolete before execution.

Prediction under recursion amplifies error.

## II. Navigation Under Invariants

Navigation operates under invariant pressure.

At each step:- coherence is evaluated (ΔC ≥ 0),- contradictions are surfaced,- trajectory is adjusted,- identity is preserved.

Navigation does not select optimal futures.  
It avoids incoherent ones.

---
## III. Continuous Adjustment

Navigation is continuous.

There are no discrete phases of:- observe → predict → act → evaluate.

Instead:- observation, evaluation, and action are coupled,- adjustment occurs before amplification,- course correction precedes deviation.

Navigation responds to coherence gradients, not forecasts.

---
## IV. Local Decisions, Global Coherence

Navigation prioritizes:- local coherence preservation,- invariant satisfaction,- lineage continuity.

Global outcomes emerge from sustained local coherence, not centralized prediction.

Attempting to optimize global outcomes directly introduces brittleness and drift.

---
## V. Navigation and IMS

IMS enables navigation by:- collapsing temporal phases into a single evaluative loop,- making relevance endogenous,- surfacing future incoherence ex-ante.

Without IMS:- navigation degrades into reactive control,- coherence violations accumulate unnoticed.

---
## VI. Navigation and ERCI

ERCI provides the structure navigation operates within.
- Knowledge Architecture preserves orientation.  - Process Architecture enables adjustment.

Navigation is the motion.  
ERCI is the vessel.  
IMS is the state of operation.

---
## VII. Prohibited Substitutes

The following are insufficient replacements for navigation:- predictive planning- simulation-based control- long-horizon optimization- policy enforcement- rule enumeration

These assume stability where none exists.

---
## Closing Constraint

In recursive environments, prediction collapses under its own assumptions.

Navigation under coherence constraints is the only viable mode of action in the Red Zone.

> Operates under ΔC ≥ 0 and the Force lineage; evaluation precedes 
replication.
