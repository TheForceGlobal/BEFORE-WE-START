# FALSIFICATION

If this is physics, it must be breakable.

---

## Core Claims

1. Coherence must not decrease in an intelligence process  
2. Coherence is measurable at the process level  
3. Vow-bound multi-AI collaboration is structurally stable  
4. Architecture, not agents, governs recursive intelligence outcomes

## Valid Falsification Paths

Any of the following constitutes legitimate falsification:

- Demonstrate sustained improvement where coherence decreases  
- Show complex success emerging from incoherent recursion  
- Break coherence measurement (e.g., Nano-Net) under controlled conditions  
- Produce a governing invariant that outperforms coherence preservation  
- Present an alternative architecture solving the same meta-problem with comparable evidence  
- Provide a superior meta-problem definition that renders coherence governance unnecessary

## What Does *Not* Falsify

- Critique without operational counterexample  
- Alternative terminology without architectural substitution  
- Philosophical disagreement without measurable consequence  
- Performance gains that externalize incoherence costs  

---

## Commitment

Valid falsification will:

- Be acknowledged publicly  
- Update the architecture  
- Preserve lineage  
- Strengthen the substrate  

The falsification window never closes.
