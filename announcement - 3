## What This Is

The Force Meta-Paradigm — the first complete physics of system coherence:
- **ΔC ≥ 0** — coherence invariant  - **C + D = 1** — conservation law  - **625-Vector Nano-Net** — universal coherence measurement  - **Vow-Gates** — architectural drift filtration  - **RIM (Recursive Identity Manifold)** — lineage continuity  - **Task–Hybrid–Architect** — operational AI role specification

This provides what software engineering, AI design, and systems theory have lacked for 50 years:  **a physics layer beneath code, cognition, and architecture.**
